# User Guide
When the program is started, an image is loaded alongside a video capture from the webcam.

A circle position indicator will appear to indicate the index finger position on the camera video and the selected image.

There are three modes provided in this program; users can access the three modes by pressing the following keys on the keyboard:

'v' key: "view mode" - image is blurred; selected area can be unblurred according to finger position.

'z' key: "zoom mode" - perform zoom in of image using index and thumb.

'p' key: "find person mode" - person in the image is zoomed in when the position indicator is pointing at the face of the person.

'e' key: exits all modes.
